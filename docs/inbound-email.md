# Inbound email

## Inbound Email

Escalated can create and reply to tickets from incoming emails. Supports **Mailgun**, **Postmark**, **AWS SES** webhooks, and **IMAP** polling as a fallback.

### How It Works

1. An external email service receives an email at your support address (e.g., `support@yourapp.com`)
2. The service forwards the email to your application via webhook (or IMAP polling fetches it)
3. Escalated normalizes the payload into an `InboundMessage` DTO via the adapter
4. The `InboundEmailService` processes the message:
   - **Thread matching**: when `ESCALATED_EMAIL_INBOUND_SECRET` is set, only the signed Reply-To address (`reply+{id}.{hmac8}@domain`) that outbound notifications carry identifies a ticket. Without a secret, the `In-Reply-To` / `References` headers and the subject reference (e.g., `[ESC-00001]`) are used instead
   - **Sender check**: a threaded email becomes a reply only when the `From` address is the ticket's requester (the guest email, or the requester user's email). The reply is posted as that requester. Staff identity is never taken from the `From` header, so agents reply in the app, not by email
   - **Match found**: adds a reply to the existing ticket; reopens the ticket if it was resolved or closed
   - **No match, or a sender who is not the requester**: creates a new ticket — if the sender is a registered user they become the requester, otherwise a guest ticket is created
5. Every inbound email is logged to `escalated_inbound_emails` for audit

### Enable Inbound Email

```env
ESCALATED_INBOUND_EMAIL=true
ESCALATED_INBOUND_ADDRESS=support@yourapp.com
```

### Adapter Setup

#### Mailgun

```env
ESCALATED_INBOUND_ADAPTER=mailgun
ESCALATED_MAILGUN_SIGNING_KEY=your-mailgun-signing-key
```

Configure a Mailgun Route to forward inbound emails to:

```
POST https://yourapp.com/support/inbound/mailgun
```

The signing key is in your Mailgun dashboard under **Settings > API Keys > HTTP Webhook Signing Key**. Requests are verified via HMAC-SHA256 signature.

#### Postmark

```env
ESCALATED_INBOUND_ADAPTER=postmark
ESCALATED_POSTMARK_INBOUND_TOKEN=your-postmark-inbound-token
```

Configure an Inbound Webhook in your Postmark server settings pointing to:

```
POST https://yourapp.com/support/inbound/postmark
```

The token is sent in the `X-Postmark-Token` header and verified on each request.

#### AWS SES

```env
ESCALATED_INBOUND_ADAPTER=ses
ESCALATED_SES_REGION=us-east-1
ESCALATED_SES_TOPIC_ARN=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789:your-topic
```

1. Configure SES to receive emails and publish to an SNS topic
2. Create an HTTPS subscription on the SNS topic pointing to:
   ```
   POST https://yourapp.com/support/inbound/ses
   ```
3. Escalated auto-confirms the SNS subscription and verifies message signatures using Amazon's certificate

#### IMAP (Fallback)

For providers without webhook support, poll via IMAP:

```env
ESCALATED_INBOUND_ADAPTER=imap
ESCALATED_IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com
ESCALATED_IMAP_PORT=993
ESCALATED_IMAP_ENCRYPTION=ssl
ESCALATED_IMAP_USERNAME=support@yourapp.com
ESCALATED_IMAP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
ESCALATED_IMAP_MAILBOX=INBOX
```

Schedule the poll command:

```php
Schedule::command('escalated:poll-imap')->everyMinute();
```

### Webhook URL

```
POST /{prefix}/inbound/{adapter}
```

Where `{prefix}` is your configured route prefix (default: `support`) and `{adapter}` is `mailgun`, `postmark`, or `ses`. These routes use the `api` middleware (no CSRF, no auth).

### Processing Features

- **Thread detection** via the signed Reply-To address, or (without an inbound secret) the `In-Reply-To` / `References` headers and subject reference pattern (`[ESC-00001]`); replies are accepted only from the ticket's requester
- **Guest tickets** for unknown senders — display name derived from email (e.g., `john.doe@example.com` → `John Doe`)
- **Subject sanitization** — strips `RE:`, `FW:`, `FWD:` prefixes (including stacked)
- **HTML fallback** — uses stripped HTML body when plain text is empty
- **Duplicate detection** — skips messages with duplicate `Message-ID` headers
- **Attachment handling** — stores attachments respecting `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_attachments_per_reply`
- **Auto-reopen** — reopens resolved/closed tickets when the requester replies via email
- **Audit logging** — every inbound email recorded in `escalated_inbound_emails` with status tracking

### Custom Adapter

Implement the `InboundAdapter` interface:

```php
use Escalated\Laravel\Mail\Adapters\InboundAdapter;
use Escalated\Laravel\Mail\InboundMessage;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class MyAdapter implements InboundAdapter
{
    public function parseRequest(Request $request): InboundMessage
    {
        return new InboundMessage(
            fromEmail: $request->input('from'),
            fromName: $request->input('name'),
            toEmail: $request->input('to'),
            subject: $request->input('subject'),
            bodyText: $request->input('text'),
            bodyHtml: $request->input('html'),
            messageId: $request->input('message_id'),
            inReplyTo: $request->input('in_reply_to'),
        );
    }

    public function verifyRequest(Request $request): bool
    {
        return $request->header('X-Secret') === config('services.my_adapter.secret');
    }
}
```
